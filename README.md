# Calculator-with-JS
My first attempt at building a calculator

This is my first attempt at building a calculator. I've been learning javascript for a couple of months now and i tried my best to try to create a simple calculator to test if im able to build something by myself without help and this is the result. i did struggle and i know its bad code but i was really excited to see that it actually worked. Great first step for me and looking forward to improving! Next step is improving this code to make it smaller.
